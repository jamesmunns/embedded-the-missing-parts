# Embedded: The Missing Parts

This book aims to caputure everything that I have found incredibly useful in delivering a successful embedded project, but is often overlooked (or not known) by embedded teams "in the field".

This thread started as a topic list, built in collaboration with a number of other engineers (todo: list everyone from the original embedded collective!) as a table of contents.

Sadly, this table of contents sat as a to-do list for 2.5 years, so in 2020, I decided to revive it as a [giant twitter thread](https://twitter.com/bitshiftmask/status/1321623304004866050), also available unrolled on [Thread Reader App](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1321623304004866050.html).

I am treating the twitter thread as the rough draft of this book, and capturing the tweets here, largely unedited, for now. In the future, I may decide to edit this and prepare it to be an actual book. For now, enjoy my passing twitter thoughts.

## The Plug

Here's my plug, if you like this, let me know, and if your embedded team needs help, [reach out to me](mailto:james.munns@ferrous-systems.com) or us at [@FerrousSystems](https://twitter.com/FerrousSystems)! We help with this stuff a lot, in Rust and in other languages.
